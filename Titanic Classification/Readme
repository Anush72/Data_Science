1. Predicting survived people in titanic dataset. 
2. Loading Libraries
3. Reading csv files, we have two csv files training and testing files
4. Checking the info of dataset, we have 12 columns in dataset
5. Dropping the columns we didnot need or doesnot give importance to target
6. Checking the null values in both training and testing set
7. Filling the null values with mean in integer and mode in categorical value
8. One Hot encoding to encode categorical value into numerical value, as there is no hiearchy between category
9. Separating the target and variables in training set
10. Joining the variables with encoded variables
11. Featuring scaling the values with standarization method
12. Training the dataset with random forest model 
13. As, we see the accuracy score using cross validation with fold 10 is 0.80
14. Again, Training the dataset with Support vector machine using kernel function 'rbf' with random state = 42
15. The accuracy score is 0.82 which is greater than random forest
16. At last, we predict the test. we can say that we are 82.38 percent sure abou the survival rate.

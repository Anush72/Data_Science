Predicting survived people in titanic dataset. 
Loading Libraries
Reading csv files, we have two csv files training and testing files
Checking the info of dataset, we have 12 columns in dataset
Dropping the columns we didnot need or doesnot give importance to target
Checking the null values in both training and testing set
Filling the null values with mean in integer and mode in categorical value
One Hot encoding to encode categorical value into numerical value, as there is no hiearchy between category
Separating the target and variables in training set
Joining the variables with encoded variables
Featuring scaling the values with standarization method
Training the dataset with random forest model 
As, we see the accuracy score using cross validation with fold 10 is 0.80
Again, Training the dataset with Support vector machine using kernel function 'rbf' with random state = 42
The accuracy score is 0.82 which is greater than random forest
At last, we predict the test. we can say that we are 82.38 percent sure abou the survival.

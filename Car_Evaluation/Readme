In this project, I used Car Evaluation Dataset get from UCI Repository and did classification using Random Forest Classifier.
Steps I take to complete this projects
1. Importing the Libraries
2. Importing the Dataset from UCI
3. Looking at the dataset ( no null values)
4. Looking at the variation of dataset (contain the same number of different values of differnt columns) and dataset is Balanced
5. All columns are categorical and have the order on it so I used Label Encoder to transform data into features
6. Looking at the target and the target is imbalanced.
7. Using stratify to equally balance the dataset on training and testing set.
8. Transforming the target into label using LabelEncoder(0 - acc ,1 - good,2-unacc,3-vgood)
9. Training the dataset in RandomForestClassifier
10. Looking at the Generalization of model using cross val and got 0.944 accuracy with 0.031 variation
11. Looking for best model and parameter using GridSearchCV
12. Testing on test set and got 0.97 accuracy.
13. acc = 0 , good = 1, 2 = unacc and 3 = vgood
13. Confusion Matrix 72 - Truly label as 0 , 4 instances predicted as 0  but 1 and 1 as 0 but 2. 
True label as 1 = 13 but 1 instances was predicted as 0 which is 1. 
True label as 2 = 240 but 2 predited as 0 but 2. 
True label as 3 = 12 but 1  predicted as 0 but 3.

As I used dataset from Scikit Learn Library for Classification of Handwritten digit MNIST. I tried different model like Random forest, Decision Tree and K nearest neighbours. I got high accuracy at KNN. 
Steps 
•	Importing Libraries
•	Loading dataset from sklearn 
•	Splitting dataset into training and testing set
•	The dataset is cleaned in library
•	Training dataset on KNN using training set
•	Predicting testing set
•	Evaluating the model using accuracy and confusion matrix
•	Tunning hyperparameter
•	Training the dataset on

  As we find the best model for classification, we tuned the hyperparameter and again train the data on tuned hyperparameter and our accuracy increase by 0.002.

In this project, I used unsupervised learning machine learning (clustering K means) to segement the customer spending
based on annual income and age also. 
Data used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/mall-customers-segmentation
Features : 5
Steps in project
1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading the dataset 
3. Histogram of all features
4. Seeing varainace in dataset
5. I used elbow method to find the cluster in data
6. Selecting the relevant features
7. Importing Kmeans from cluster module of sklearn.
8. Making varaibale wccs with empty list
9. range from(1,11) to find optimal cluster from 1 to 10.
10. In elbow method, we look for the point where the line goes smootly to down.
11. we find the point 5 where line goes smoothly and choose 5 as cluster
12. Training the data using K means cluster
13. As in figure we can see that we got five different cluster with different colors.
14. We can easily disntinguish the customer spending habit with their annual income.
15. Same step for Age also but we cannot clearly see proper cluster as spending score doesnot depend on age.

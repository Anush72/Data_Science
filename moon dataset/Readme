In this project I used moon dataset in decision tree classification.
Steps 
1. Importing the libraries
2. Making moon dataset from scikit learn 
3. Splitting dataset into training and testing set
4. Training the dataset on Decision Tree classifier imported from scikit learn
5. Cross validation and got 0.778 accuracy
6. Grid Search to search best hyperparameter
7. Predicting the dataset with best model
8. Got 0.8445 accuracy

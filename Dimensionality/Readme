In this project, I learn about the Dimensionality Reduction and Its type. I used MNIST dataset to use the different algorithm for dimension Reduction
Steps in this projects
1. Importing the Libraries (numpy, pandas and matplotlib)
2. Loading the datset from scikit learn(sklearn.datasets)
3. Splitting dataset into training and testing set
4. Importing PCA and trained on Training set 
5. As we can see the variance in each principal component
6.To create first component to have 0.95 Varaince of Dataset
7. Using numpy argmax to get the number of features reduce to get 0.95
8. 154 number of features we got 0.95 in first principal component
9. We can use randomized or incremental PCA to reduced the dimesnion of features
10. Random projection to project the high dimesnion into lower dimension (importing johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dm)
11. we can also set hyperparameter in PCA to get 0.95 variance in first component analysis.
12. Training the dataset on both reduced and non-reduced dataset we got less accuracy on reduced dataset when using randomforestclassifier.
13. Training the dataset on SGDclassifier we got 0.897 accuracy which less than the random forest classifier.
14. Using TSNE to transform dataset into 2D for nice plots.
15. But using PCA doesnot give nice plots as TSNE.

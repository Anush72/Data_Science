In this project, I learn small things about unsupervised learning and 
some great concepts in unsupervised learning(K means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture)
How to use elbow and silhouette method to find n number of cluster in kmeans
steps I taken in this project 
1. Importing the Libraries
2. Making Blobs
3. Seeing the shape of X and y
4. Seeing the scatter plot of graph
5. Using Elbow method to find number of cluster and from graph the number of cluster is 3.
6. Seeing the scatter plot and how kmeans split the dataset into three cluster
7. Using Silhouette Graph we can see the number of cluster to be 5 which is perfect cluster
8. Using 5 cluster to train model and seeing scatter plot we can see how k means clear distinguish the five cluster
9. Making moon dataset and using the DBSCAN algorith to find the clusters in dataset. In this algorithm perfectly find the
clusters and for DBSCAN we have to tune eps and min_smaples.
10. Looking at Gaussian mixture and we got differnt weights, means and covaraince according to number of clusters.

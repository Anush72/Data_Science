In this project, I build the model to predict the diabetes. I used Kaggle dataset make model.
Packages :- numpy, pandas, matplotlib,scikitlearn,pickle and seaborn
numpy = for passing numpy array in model for training
pandas - for data wrangling, statistics
matplotlib, seaborn - visualization
scikitlearn - training the model 
pickel - to save model
Steps in Projects
a. Loading the Csv files
b. looking at the data like info, head, summary statistics, null values and data types
c. Statistics Like Correlation, overall statistics
d. Looking at histogram of features and see the distribution 
e. Looking at box plot for outliers and distribution of diabetes in various factor like hypertension and smoking hsitory
f. Cob=nverting the gender and smoking_history into label using Label Encoder
g. Splitting the dependent and independent variables
h. Splitting the dataset into training and testing set
g. Training on Random forest model and looking at cross validation score which is 0.96 mean value with 0.0019 spreadness
i. Training on AdaBosster and looking at cross validation score which is 0.971 with variation 0.001 spreadness which is very low
h. Hyperparamter tunning using random search for f1 score 
i. Classification report and confusion matrix for checking the metrics
j. We got 0.69 recall on Neagtive class so I am going to change the threshold to gain the high recall because True Negative is highly sensitive in medical field.
k. Looking at Precision recall curve for deciding the threshold and I set threshold to 0.43 which gives 0.97 recall which will catch more Negative class but False Positive increase which be tested again
j. Saving the model with threshold

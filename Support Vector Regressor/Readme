I used support vector regressor to predict housing value of californication and how well support vector fit the dataset
Dataset - Module of Sklearn datasets with function fetch_california_housing which is cleaned
Steps that I take for this projects
1. importing pandas and numpy
2. Loading dataset and getting features and target
3. We have 8 features( dimension) that is median income, House Agem, Average rooms, Average Bedrooms, population, Average Occupation, Latitude and longitude and target Median house value.
4. Seeing the varaiance and description of features. No huge difference in varaiance
5. Converting dataframe in array 
6. Splitting the training and testing set using train_test_split function of model_selection of sklearn
7. Feature scaling standarization ( value range from - 3 to + 3) using StandardScaler
8. Training the data on SVR with kernel 'rbf'
9. cross_val_score to predict the model evaluation in 5 folds of data.
10. We got 0.71 r2 score which is good and -0.61 means model prediction are off by 61,000 from actual values
11. Searching for best parameters and model using GridSearchCV
12. Overall, We get 0.61 in rmse which isnot great model and r2 0.71 means model is average overall.

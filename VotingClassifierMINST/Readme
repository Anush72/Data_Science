In this project I used voting classifier to classify the MINST dataset. In this dataset we
have to classify the digits from 0 to 9. The dataset taken from sklearn.datasets.
Steps in this project
1. Lodaing Libraries
2. Loading Dataset from sickit learn datasets
3. Looking at the dataset
4. splitting dataset into training,validation and test set
5. Importing Models like Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, Linear Support Vector, K Neighbors Classifier
6. Training all models
7.Looking at the accuracy Score at validation set
8. AMking list of model and Importing the voting classifier
9. training the voting classifier
10. We got 0.9731 accuracy score in valid set and removing svc increase the accuracy by 0.002
11. Testing the accuracy in test set and got 0.972 accuracy

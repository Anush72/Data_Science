Making the movie recommendation using apriori algorithm
Dataset from MovieLens URL:https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
Using Module : pandas and matplotlib, mlxtend,re(regular expression), worcloud and collections
pandas: Data wrangling, looking at data
matplotlib: looking at the charts
mlxtend : applying the aprior algorithm and association rules
wordcloud : looking at the most watched movies
collections: Counting the movies from the list

Steps I take in this projects
1. importing the datasets movies.csv and ratings.csv
2. Combining the datasets using movieId
3. Cleaning the title using re movie
4. Making the basket movie by userID
5.Making the list from title to look at wordcloud
6. Looking at the top 20 movies
7. Converting the title into vector using TransactionalEncoder
8.Applying the Apriori Rules(with minimum support = 0.1 and Association Rules with confidence = 0.5)
9. Making the recommendation function
10.looking at recommendation

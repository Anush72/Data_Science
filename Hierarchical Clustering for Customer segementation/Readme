In this project, I used unsupervised learning machine learning (clustering Hierachical cluster) to segement the customer spending
based on annual income and age also. 
Data used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/mall-customers-segmentation
Features : 5
Steps in project
1. Importing libraries
2. Loading dataset
3. Using dendogram to find the cluster in dataset
4. import hiearchy from scipy.cluster
5. for finding the number of cluster in dendogram we have to look for largest distance of vertical line which isnot 
  cut by horizontal line. As blue line in left and orange line in right is comparatively equal so I used both line to make cluster
and try differntly.
6. As we cut blue line we got three cluster
7. Training dataset on AgglomerativeClustering import from cluster module of sklearn(scikit-learn)
8. Visualizing the clustering and not seeing good segementation of cluster.
9. So I used five cluster to segment the dataset and get good visualization and result.

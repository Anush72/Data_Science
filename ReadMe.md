# Rice Classification 
# In this project I used Rice dataset to classify two class that is Osmanick and Cammeo
# Steps I take for this project
Importing the Libraries
Importing dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis to look out the dataset
Histogram for looking the distribution of dataset
Transforming the class into 0 and 1
Splitting dataset into training and testing set
Feature Scaling the dataset
Importing Logistic Regression and training the dataset
We got 0.92 accuracy with variation 0.016 
Training the dataset on Linear SVC and got same accuracy as Logistic Regression
Training the dataset on decision tree and got 0.88 accuracy with 0.019 variation
Tunning the hyperparameter
Training the dataset on KNeighbors and got high accuracy on logistic regression
Testing logistic regression on test set and got 0.91 accuracy

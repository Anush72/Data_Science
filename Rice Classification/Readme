In this project, I used rice dataset to classify the two classes of dataset.
# Steps to be taken in this project
1. Importing Libraries and Loading dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to look out the dataset
3. Dropping the features which have high correlation.
4. Transforming the class into label using Label Encoder
5. Feature SCaling using StandardScaler
6. Training the dataset on Logistic Regression 
7. Cross Validation on training set and got 0.92 accuracy with 0.016 variation.
8. Training the dataset on Linear SVC and got same result as logistic Regression.
9. Training the dataset on Decison Tree and got accuracy 0.88 with 0.019 variation.
10. Tunning the hyperparameter of logistic regression.
11. Training the dataset on KNN and got 0.91 accuracy with 0.013 varitaion.
12. Got the high accuracy with logistic regression
13. Testing on test set and got 0.914 accuracy.
14. Confusion Matrix: 290 True Negative, 36 False Positive, 29 False Negative and
407 True Positive.

Classification of Iris flower
In this dataset, we have to classify the three classes of iris flower.
Setosa:0 , Versicolor:1, and Virginica:2
# Following steps to do classification
1. importing libraries
2. importing iris dataset using Module dataset of sklearn and function load_iris
3. We have features and target
4. splitting dataset into train and test set
5. Using StandardScaler to Feature scaling 
6. Importing KNeighborsClassifier(KNN), Gaussian NB and metrics like Confusion_Matrix, classification_report and accuracy_score
7. Training the dataset on KNN 
8. Importing cross_val_score to check the accuracy among differnt folds and StratifiedKFold to balancing the dataset
9. Cross validation to see the model performance across different folds of data
10.As in KNN, we got 0.90 accuracy and 0.03 variation which good 
11. We did same in naive bayes and get 0.93 with 0.3 variation.
12. So, I choose naive bayes to test testing set
13. We got 1 accuracy in test set which is good. we get 100 percent accuracy maybe due to small number of test and the data is well cleaned.

In this classification, I used simple dataset of iris flower to classify the different classes
Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica (Three classes)
I get this dataset from sklearn.datasets.load_iris
Steps and what I learn from this dataset
1. Importing Libraries (numpy and pandas)
2. lodaing dataset and getting features and target
3. looking shape of both target and features
4. splitting dataset in both training and testing set
5. Feature scaling using standarization
6. Importing the model KNeighborsClassifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
7. Importing the metrics to evaulate the dataset
8. Training on Kneighbors classifier
9. We can see evaluation as in classification report we get 100 percent accuracy,
recision and precision is also 100 percent. Looking at confusion matrix we got correct prediction
10. So,  I used cross validation score to test , is model overfitting. I got nice accuracy score in cross fold 5
11. Training the model on Naive bayes and got same as KNN.
12. I used cross_val_score to determine is model is overfitting, but I got nice score in cross val score.
13. Naive bayes is better than KNN in cross validation.

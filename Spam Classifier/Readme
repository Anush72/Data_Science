In this project, I make model to detech whether the given email is spam or ham. The dataset I used in this project available at https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/.
The dataset Iused in this project are a) 20021010_easy_ham.tar.bz2, b) 20021010_hard_ham.tar.bar.bz2 and c)20021010_spam.tar.bz2
Steps in this project 
1. Importing the Libraries
2. Making the Function to take the files from directory
3. loading the ham emails and spam emails and join both emails in same list
4. Converting emails list to Dataframe(pandas)
5. Shuffling the dataset
6. Using nltk and re module to clean the data. re module to remove other character in text (only alphabet),Porter Stemmer to make the word to root word(Cleaning-clean) and stopword to remove the words which didnot give value(a,a,the)
7. Converting the clean text to vectorizer and get array.
8. Getting Traget from Dataframe
9. Splitting dataset into training and testing set.
10. Using naive bayes to make model and got 0.976 accuracy with 0.0094 variance which shows that Model Generalize well on dataset.
11. Testing on test set and got 98 percent accuracy.
